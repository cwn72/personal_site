        I am a self-taught programmer, with a wider range of experiences. The monotony and lack of working with a team made me lose my passion for development, but web and mobile development have sparked a new flame for my old passion. I still hope to be able to work with a team in the future.

      A current big hobby of mine is surfing. I started surfing a bit over a year ago, and try to spend as much time as I can in the water. I'm riding a 5'6" Stewart Fartknocker(yes, that really is the name of the surfboard), and am looking to get a custom shaped local board soon. I love the challenge of riding a shortboard, and love the peace of mind that I find when I am in the water.

      I like software development. I love learning new skills and technologies, and have done everything form arduino projects, to windows hacking. Although sometimes I get frustrated when learning something new, I always find that at the end of the day, I am happy that I challenged myself, and love the feeling I get when I finally conquer the challenge.
